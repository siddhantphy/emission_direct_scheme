        Method returns the probability and new density matrix for the given measurement outcome of the given qubit.

        *** THIS METHOD IS VERY SLOW FOR LARGER SYSTEMS, SINCE IT DETERMINES THE SYSTEM STATE AFTER
        THE MEASUREMENT BY DIAGONALISING THE DENSITY MATRIX ***

        To explain the approach taken, consider that:
                |a_1|   |b_1|   |c_1|   |a_1 b_1 c_1|                        |a_1 b_1 c_1 a_1 b_1 c_1 ... |
                |   | * |   | * |   | = |a_1 b_1 c_2|  ---> density matrix:  |a_1 b_1 c_1 a_1 b_1 c_2 ... |
                |a_2|   |b_2|   |c_2|   |a_1 b_2 c_1|                        |a_1 b_1 c_1 a_1 b_2 c_1 ... |
                                        |    ...    |                        |          ...               |

        When the second qubit (with the elements b_1 and b_2) is measured and the outcome is a 1, it means
        that b_1 is 0 and b_2 is 1. This thus means that all elements of the density matrix that are built up
        out of b_1 elements are 0 and only the elements not containing b_1 elements survive. This way a new
        density matrix can be constructed of which the trace is equal to the probability of this outcome occurring.
        Pattern of the elements across the density matrix can be compared with a chess pattern, where the square
        dimension reduce by a factor of 2 with the qubit number.

    This private method calculates the probability of a certain measurement outcome and calculates the
    resulting density matrix after the measurement has taken place.

    ----
    Probability calculation:

    From the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the density matrix before the measurement, first the probability
    of the specified outcome (0 or 1) for the given qubit is calculated. This is done by setting the opposite
    outcome for the qubit to 0 in the eigenvectors. Remember, the eigenvectors represent a system state and are thus
    the possible qubit states tensored. Thus an eigenvector is built up as:

    |a_1|   |b_1|   |c_1|   |a_1 b_1 c_1|
    |   | * |   | * |   | = |a_1 b_1 c_2| (and so on)
    |a_2|   |b_2|   |c_2|   |a_1 b_2 c_1|
                                  :

    So lets say that we measure qubit c to be 1, this means that c_1 is zero. For each eigenvector we will set the
    elements that contain c_2 to zero, which leaves us with the states (if not a zero vector) that survive after
    the measurement. While setting these elements to zero, the other elements (that contain c_2) are saved to an
    array. From this array, the non-zero array is obtained which is then absolute squared, summed and multiplied
    with the eigenvalue for that eigenvector. These values obtained from all the eigenvectors are then summed to
    obtain the probability for the given outcome.

    ----

    Density matrix calculation:

    The density matrix after the measurement is obtained by taking the CT of the adapted eigenvectors by the
    probability calculations, multiply the result with the eigenvalue for that eigenvector and add all resulting
    matrices.

    ----------
